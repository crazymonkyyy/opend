Shortened method syntax can now be used in constructors

This used to raise an error "cannot return expression from constructor", but it's now supported:

---
struct Number
{
    int x;

    this(int x) => this.x = x;
    this(float x) => this(cast(int) x);
}
---

Postblits and destructors already supported shortened method syntax because they return `void`.
